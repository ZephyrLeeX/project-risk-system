Architecture changes:
- ADR 0017: Audit is metadata-only; no snapshot/redaction.
- ADR 0018: Durable tasks use PostgreSQL task/outbox facts, domain-to-task references, fenced leases and at-least-once dispatch.
- ADR 0019: Agent API, confirmation and PostgreSQL-backed SSE contract.
- ADR 0020: Agent Celery execution and domain-command contract.
- ADR 0021: PostgreSQL weekly aggregate lifecycle contract.

Environment:
- Python validation via mise explicit tool selection.
- PostgreSQL integration tests required where applicable.

Important invariants:
- FastAPI is production backend.
- NestJS reference-only.
- PostgreSQL only.
- No dual write.
- Human-facing reports Chinese.
